# Faculty Hackathon Project: Science Gateways Integration

### Mentee
**Connor Flynn**  
*Chaminade University of Honolulu*

Connor Flynn is a Data Scientist at Chaminade University of Honolulu and the United Nations CIFAL Honolulu Centre. He earned a Masterâ€™s in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & MAnagement at UCSB. He serves as the Education Director for the NSF INCLUDES SPICE Alliance, advancing data science education across the Pacific region. Connor teaches Bayesian Statistics, Geocomputation, and Cartographic Design, integrating real-world datasets into interactive learning experiences.  
His research spans environmental analytics, machine learning, and public health, with a focus on Pacific resilience and equity.

## Home Institution
**Chaminade University**

---

## Target Courses & Enrollment
- **Bayesian Stats (DS 400)**: Anticipated Enrollment ~ 15 students  
- **Geocomputation (DS 422)**: Anticipated Enrollment ~ 20 students  

---

## Science Gateways Resource Needs & Questions
- R Software download vs. Cloud Computing solutions  
- How to use **GitHub Classroom** effectively while building student portfolios  
- Introducing Environmental Science students to *science gateways* with low-barrier entry points  

---

## Project Goals: *Science Gateways*
### Goal 1: GitHub Classroom & Student Portfolios  
- Utilize **GitHub Classroom** while still building professional portfolios  
- Introduce larger datasets to Bayesian Stats & Geocomputation  
- Explore *Bayesian Applications in Climate Modeling*  

---

### Goal 2: Satellite Data & APIs  
- Identify efficient ways to work with satellite data (APIs, R packages, etc.)  
- Explore resources through **The Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Gateway**  

---

### Goal 3: JetStream Virtual Machines  
- Incorporate **JetStream VMs** into class workflows for hands-on data science training  

---

## Quick Links
- [EOSDIS Gateway](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis)  
- [JetStream Cloud](https://jetstream-cloud.org/)  
- [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)  

---

## Next Steps
1. Define workflows for GitHub Classroom integration  
2. Curate datasets for Bayesian and Geocomputation classes  
3. Explore API-based access to satellite data  
4. Set up JetStream VM environments for students
